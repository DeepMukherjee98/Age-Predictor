# Age-Predictor
This model was created using the pre trained caffe model to detect face from the OpenCV DNN module.
The caffe models are the weights and the Prototxt are the Model structure.


Just clone or download the repo and run the .py file.

I have used OpenCv video capture to do real time prediction .
